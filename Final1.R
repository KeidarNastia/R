data <- read.csv("./OSA-childhood trauma - Raw Data.csv")

# Step 1 - Defining the research question ----

# 1. Dataset - Write a few sentences describing the data set and why you chose it.

# The dataset used in this analysis examines various health-related factors, including daytime sleepiness (ESS), presence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and history of childhood trauma.
# It includes measures of trauma history (ETISR-SF subscales), demographic variables (Age, BMI, Menopause status), and clinical outcomes.  
# I chose this dataset because my research focuses on childhood abuse, and I wanted to work with existing data rather than my own.
# Additionally, since my doctoral research does not involve experimental or control groups, I wanted to gain experience analyzing data that includes distinct comparison groups (OSA vs. Control). 
# This allowed me to explore methodologies and statistical approaches that I might not typically use in my work.

# 2. Preview data using the ggdist or ggplot package.

# Descriptive statistics

# 3. The research question

# Does OSA mediate the relationship between childhood trauma history and daytime sleepiness?

# Step 2 - Pre-processing the data ----

# 1. Predictor/predicted variables for the analysis.
# Dependent Variable: daytime sleepiness as measured by ESS (Epworth Sleepiness Scale).
# Predictors: Childhood trauma as measured by ETISR-SF (General,Physical, Emotional and Sexual).
# Mediating variable: OSA as measured by "Group".
# Variables to monitor: Age, BMI.

# 2. Process the variables

data <- data |>
  mutate(
    Trauma_total = ETISRSF_General + ETISRSF_Physical + ETISRSF_Emotional + ETISRSF_Sexual,
    Group_binary = as.integer(Group == "OSA")
    )

# 3. Creating a function

  df |>
    group_by(Group_binary) |>  
    summarise(
      across(all_of(vars),
             list(mean = ~mean(.x, na.rm = TRUE),
                  sd = ~sd(.x, na.rm = TRUE)),
             .names = "{.col}_{.fn}"),
      .groups = "drop"
    )
  }

summary_stats <- calculate_summary(data, c("Age", "BMI", "Trauma_total", "ESS"))

print(summary_stats)

# 4. Using a function from a package we haven't learned about

skim(data[data$Group_binary == 1, c("Age", "BMI", "ESS", "Trauma_total")])

# Step 3 - Data analysis ----
# 1. a. Regression Analysis - Multiple Linear Regression

linear_model <- lm(ESS ~ Trauma_total + Age + BMI, data = data)
summary(linear_model)

# 2. a. Interpretation of the results

tidy(linear_model, conf.int = TRUE)

# Trauma_total is not significant (p = 0.171), but the direction is positive (B = 0.184).
# The model explains only 16.4% of the variance in ESS (RÂ² = 0.164).
# Conclusion: The relationship between trauma and ESS is very weak and not significant.
# Here we already see that there is not a strong enough relationship to justify mediation.

# 3. a. A graph

ggplot(data, aes(x = Trauma_total, y = ESS)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6, color = "#00BFC4") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, color = "#F8766D") +
  labs(title = "Effect of Trauma on ESS", 
       x = "Trauma_total", 
       y = "ESS") +
  theme_minimal()

# 1. b. Regression Analysis - Logistic Regression.

logistic_model <- glm(Group_binary ~ Trauma_total + Age + BMI, data = data, family = binomial)
summary(logistic_model)

# 2. b. Interpretation of the results

logistic_results <- tidy(logistic_model, conf.int = TRUE, exponentiate = TRUE)
model_diagnostics <- glance(logistic_model)
list(results = logistic_results, diagnostics = model_diagnostics)

# Trauma_total is not significant (p = 0.781, B = 0.023).
# Age is almost significant (p = 0.056, B = 0.074).
# BMI is significant (p = 0.005, B = 0.258).
# Conclusion: Trauma does not predict OSA at all, age almost influences and BMI strongly and significantly influences.
# Since trauma does not predict OSA, there cannot be mediation of OSA on the relationship between trauma and ESS.

# 3. b. A graph

       y = "Probability of OSA",
