## Project Overview

This repository includes two main projects:
1. **Stroop Experiment**: Analysis of response times under different conditions.
2. **Descriptive Statistics Assignment**: Calculation of summary statistics for a synthetic dataset.

## A. Stroop experiment
The Stroop experiment analyzes the impact of task congruency on reaction times. Below are the summary statistics and a visualization of the results.


### Mean and Standard Deviation for Each Condition

```
  task         congruency  mean_rt sd_rt
1 ink_naming   congruent     1003.  134.
2 ink_naming   incongruent   1155.  152.
3 word_reading congruent      705.  166.
4 word_reading incongruent    724.  143.
```
### Visualization of Results

## B. Descriptive statistics assignment
This assignment involves generating a dataset and calculating descriptive statistics for both continuous and categorical variables.
